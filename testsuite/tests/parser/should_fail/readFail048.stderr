     Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’
      Expected type: [[Char]]
        Actual type: [Char]
     In the second argument of ‘(:)’, namely ‘"Type error on line 25"’
      In the expression:
          "Type error on line 25" : "Type error on line 25"
      In an equation for ‘type_error’:
          type_error = "Type error on line 25" : "Type error on line 25"
